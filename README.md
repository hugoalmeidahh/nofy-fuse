- **feat**: Additions of new features or any other new implementations to the code.
- **fix**: Essentially define the treatment of bug fixes.
- **refactor**: Used for any changes that are executed in the code, but do not alter the final functionality of the impacted task.
- **docs**: Inclusion or modification only of documentation files.
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance.
- **style**: Changes related to code formatting that do not affect the meaning of the code, such as whitespace, formatting, missing semicolon, etc.
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests in automated testing processes (TDD).
- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm).
- **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs).
- **env**: Used in the description of modifications or additions in configuration files in continuous integration (CI) processes and methods, such as parameters in container configuration files. _For example_:
